# angular5bootstrapper
This is my personal angular 5 browser bootstrapper.

Feel free to clone or fork it.

It's essentially plug and play for when you're away from your local machine and want to test something quick and dirty.

Most of the credit goes to whoever put together the tsconfig, jsconfig, and systemjs.config.js files. I simply updated everything from Angular 2 to 5 and cleaned up the directory structure for my own purposes.
